Welcome to game room, we are so excited to have you here and we cannot wait to see what you create. This is supposed to be a platform for individuals to practice their coding, problem solving, pair programming, teamwork, and working in the context of a larger project. 

If you have made it this far, then we are excited to see what you create. Fork and clone the repo first. Then make a copy of the src/games/template folder and then place that in the src/games directory. Rename the folder, ExampleGame.js, and any other file to your game's name. 

You can also go to App.js, and add an appropriate route to navigate to your game. Please do not modify the navbar, it is a work in progress. 

Your are welcome to make anything you want in your game, it is your own creative space. Just please use similar styling and reactstrap when possible, and make sure to include the GameInfo component at the end of your game. We want to accurately attribute and describe each page.

Once completed, the code will be reviewed and added to the master branch and added to the site!! Around this time, you can also be added to the contributors page.

Have fun! Any questions, ask Ben
