The game room is a project designed to allow a individuals to practice and apply newly acquired programming skills in the setting of a larger project. There are an ever growing number of games or other neat coding accomplishments scattered across the site. Each page will have a list of contributors at the bottom so that budding developers can display their creativity and coding prowess.

This site is also supposed to let fresh developers practice working as a team on a larger project. They will need to work with version control, pair programming, and customer requirements. It is supposed to be a fun and approachable way for individuals to prepare for the factors in the workplace that may not have been taught in school or in a bootcamp.

Please feel free to look around and have fun. If any of the pages impress you, do not hesitate to look at the contributors and check out some of their other work. And if you are interested in contributing to the site, please continue reading. 

Feel free to fork and clone this repository anytime to start working on your contribution. If you want to contribute to gameroom, we ask that the only code you add be in your own folder you make in the directory src/games. There is a template folder there to help you get started. You may also add a route to your game in App.js. Once the addition has been approved by a moderator the game can be added to the site, and a link to find it will be added to the navbar. 

Please follow the styling other contributors have used to keep the structure of each page the same, but take as much creative liberty as you want with your game. This app is built with bootstrap and heavily uses reactstrap (https://reactstrap.github.io/). So please feel free to refer to this while working on styling your game. 

If you want to help with the entire site in some way, reach out to any moderator and they will be happy to talk to you about how you can contribute! 

Happy Coding!
